This Program helps you to fine tune llama or any other LLM Model using LoRA( ***Lo***w ***R***ank ***A***daptability). 

****LoRA is a popular and lightweight training technique that significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters. 
It works by inserting a smaller number of new weights into the model and only these are trained. 
This approach allows for targeted improvements without the need for comprehensive retraining, which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.****

Note: Please ensure that you download the model that you want to fine tune into your local system and then upload it into Google Colab. Ignore any errors you find in the file,
they might have been caused because my incompetance.
